Editing Uploaded Content
========================

Content uploaded to Funkwhale can be edited to update details such as album art,
item descriptions, tags, song positions, copyright notices, licenses and titles.
This can be helpful if an upload was not tagged correctly during upload and needs
to be corrected afterwards, or if content you've published through Funkwhale needs
to be changed at a later date.
