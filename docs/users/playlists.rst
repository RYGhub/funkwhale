Creating and Managing Playlists
===============================

Playlists are an important part of any music collection, and Funkwhale is no different. Funkwhale
allows you to create playlists for yourself, for other users on your server, or for the entire federated
network.

Creating a New Playlist
-----------------------

Once you've :doc:`uploaded some content to your instance <upload>`, or have
:doc:`followed some public libraries of your choosing <follow>`, you can get
started creating new playlists.

To create a playlist:

- Click on "Playlists" under the "Music" section on the left-hand side
- A pop-up will appear listing any of your existing playlists
- Enter a name for your playlist under the "Playlist name" section
- Choose a visibility setting:
    - **Nobody except me**: The playlist will be hidden from all users of the instance
    - **Everyone on this instance**: The playlist will be visible to local accounts, but not to external users
    - **Everyone**: The playlist will be public
- Click "Create Playlist" to commit your changes

.. note::

   If you create a public library with non-public content, users will be able to see all tracks but
   will only be able to play those that are accessible by them.
