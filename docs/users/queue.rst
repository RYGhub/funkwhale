Managing Your Queue
===================
Your queue is where you can add tracks to queue them up for listening, arrange music to create a curated list,
and even :doc:`save a list as a playlist <playlists>`.

Add Tracks to Your Queue
------------------------

There are four options to choose from when adding music to a queue:

- Play - this will start playing the selected item(s) immediately, stopping any currently playing tracks
- Add to queue - this adds the selected item(s) to the bottom of the queue. If the queue is empty, it will add them but not start playing
- Play next - this adds the selected item(s) just underneath the currently selected track in the queue
- Play now - this acts the same as "Play"
