Reporting content and accounts
==============================

Funkwhale includes a report feature you can use to contact your pod's moderators.

If you think some action, such as removal, should be taken toward an account or specific content (like an artist or a library), we encourage you to use
this feature. This is especially recommended if you find illegal or abusive content, or anything that could be an infraction of your pod's rules.

After submission, your pod moderators will be notified and will be able to :doc:`act on your report </moderator/reports>`.

Submit a report
---------------

You can submit those reports from various places in the app, depending on what you are reporting (see below).

You'll need to pick a category for your report. Available categories are:

- **Takedown request**: to request removal of copyrighted material
- **Illegal content**: to report an account, track, album, artist, library, playlist or account that features illegal content
- **Offensive content**: to report an account, track, album, artist, library, playlist or account that features offensive or abusive content
- **Invalid metadata**: to report a track, album or artist with invalid or incomplete metadata
- **Other**: to report anything else that doesn't fit into one of these categories

You can also include with your report an additional explanation to ensure moderators can understand and act on the issue.

Accountless reports
-------------------

If this feature is enabled on the pod you are browsing, you'll be able to submit reports without an account.

This works exactly the same, but the report form will have an extra "email" field where you should include a working
email address, in the event moderators need to contact you.

Reporting an account
--------------------

Accounts can be reported in two ways.

- When viewing user activity, such as favorites or listening history, the dropdown menu next to the corresponding activity will include an option to report the account
- When viewing a library the dropdown menu in the top right corner will include an option to report the corresponding account

Reporting an artist, playlist, album or track
---------------------------------------------

Anything you can play can typically be reported using the dropdown menu on the "Play" button.

Additionally, when viewing the detail page of an artist, playlist, album or track, you can find the
report option under the dropdown menu on the "More…" button.


Reporting a library
-------------------

When viewing a library the dropdown menu in the top right corner will include an option to report the library.
