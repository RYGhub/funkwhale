0.21 "Agate" (2020-04-24)
-------------------------

This 0.21 release is dedicated to Agate, to thank her, for both having created the Funkwhale project, being the current lead developer, and for her courage of coming out. Thank you Agate from all the members of the Funkwhale community <3

We are truly grateful as well to the dozens of people who contributed to this release with translations, development, documentation, reviews, design, testing, feedback, financial support, third-party projects and integrations… You made it possible!

Upgrade instructions are available at
https://docs.funkwhale.audio/admin/upgrading.html, there are also additional operations you need to execute, listed in the changelog below (search "Manual action").

Channels and podcasts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Funkwhale 0.21 includes a brand new feature: Channels!

Channels can be used as a replacement to public libraries,
to publish audio content, both musical and non-musical. They federate with other Funkwhale pods, but also other
fediverse software, in particular Mastodon, Pleroma, Friendica and Reel2Bits, meaning people can subscribe to your channel
from any of these software. To get started with publication, simply visit your profile and create a channel from there.

Each Funkwhale channel also comes with RSS feed that is compatible with existing podcasting applications, like AntennaPod
on Android and, within Funkwhale, you can also subscribe to any podcast from its RSS feed!

Many, many thanks to the numerous people who helped with the feature design, development and testing, and in particular
to the members of the working group who met every week for months in order to get this done, and the members of other third-party
projects who took the time to work with us to ensure compatibility.

Redesigned navigation, player and queue
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This release includes a full redesign of our navigation, player and queue. Overall, it should provide
a better, less confusing experience, especially on mobile devices. This redesign was suggested
14 months ago, and took a while, but thanks to the involvement and feedback of many people, we got it done!

Improved search bar for searching remote objects
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The search bar now support fetching arbitrary objects using a URL. In particular, you can use this to quickly:

- Subscribe to a remote library via its URL
- Listen a public track from another pod
- Subscribe to a channel

Screening for sign-ups and custom sign-up form
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Instance admins can now configure their pod so that registrations required manual approval from a moderator. This
is especially useful on private or semi-private pods where you don't want to close registrations completely,
but don't want spam or unwanted users to join your pod.

When this is enabled and a new user register, their request is put in a moderation queue, and moderators
are notified by email. When the request is approved or refused, the user is also notified by email.

In addition, it's also possible to customize the sign-up form by:

- Providing a custom help text, in markdown format
- Including additional fields in the form, for instance to ask the user why they want to join. Data collected through these fields is included in the sign-up request and viewable by the mods

Federated reports
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It's now possible to send a copy of a report to the server hosting the reported object, in order to make moderation easier and more distributed.

This feature is inspired by Mastodon's current design, and should work with at least Funkwhale and Mastodon servers.

Improved search performance
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Our search engine went through a full rewrite to make it faster. This new engine is enabled
by default when using the search bar, or when searching for artists, albums and tracks. It leverages
PostgreSQL full-text search capabilities.

During our tests, we observed huge performance improvements after the switch, by an order of
magnitude. This should be especially perceptible on pods with large databases, more modest hardware
or hard drives.

We plan to remove the old engine in an upcoming release. In the meantime, if anything goes wrong,
you can switch back by setting ``USE_FULL_TEXT_SEARCH=false`` in your ``.env`` file.

Enforced email verification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The brand new ``ACCOUNT_EMAIL_VERIFICATION_ENFORCE`` setting can be used to make email verification
mandatory for your users. It defaults to ``false``, and doesn't apply to superuser accounts created through
the CLI.

If you enable this, ensure you have a SMTP server configured too.

More reliable CLI importer [manual action required]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Our CLI importer is now more reliable and less prone to Out-of-Memory issues, especially when scanning large libraries. (hundreds of GB or bigger)

We've also improved the directory crawling logic, so that you don't have to use glob patterns or specify extensions when importing. As a result, the syntax for providing directories to the command as changed slightly.

If you use the ``import_files`` command, this means you should replace scripts that look like this::

    python api/manage.py import_files $LIBRARY_ID "/srv/funkwhale/data/music/**/*.ogg" "/srv/funkwhale/data/music/**/*.mp3" --recursive --noinput

By this::

    python api/manage.py import_files $LIBRARY_ID "/srv/funkwhale/data/music/" --recursive --noinput

And Funkwhale will happily import any supported audio file from the specified directory.

User management through the server CLI
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We now support user creation (incl. non-admin accounts), update and removal directly
from the server CLI. Typical use cases include:

- Changing a user password from the command line
- Creating or updating users from deployments scripts or playbooks
- Removing or granting permissions or upload quota to multiple users at once
- Marking multiple users as inactive

All user-related commands are available under the ``python manage.py fw users`` namespace.
Please refer to the `Admin documentation <https://docs.funkwhale.audio/admin/commands.html#user-management>`_ for
more information and instructions.

Progressive web app [Manual action suggested, non-docker only]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We've made Funkwhale's Web UI a Progressive Web Application (PWA), in order to improve the user experience
during offline use, and on mobile devices.

In order to fully benefit from this change, if your pod isn't deployed using Docker, ensure
the following instruction is present in your nginx configuration::

    location /front/ {
        # Add the following line in the /front/ location
        add_header Service-Worker-Allowed "/";
    }

Postgres docker changed environment variable [manual action required, docker multi-container only]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you're running with docker and our multi-container setup, there was a breaking change starting in the 11.7 postgres image (https://github.com/docker-library/postgres/pull/658)

You need to add this to your .env file: ``POSTGRES_HOST_AUTH_METHOD=trust``

Newer deployments aren't affected.

Upgrade from Postgres 10 to 11 [manual action required, docker all-in-one only]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

With our upgrade to Alpine 3.10, the ``funkwhale/all-in-one`` image now includes PostgreSQL 11.

In order to update to Funkwhale 0.21, you will first need to uprade Funkwhale's PostgreSQL database, following the steps below::

    # open a shell as the Funkwhale user
    sudo -u funkwhale -H bash

    # move to the funkwhale data directory
    # (replace this with your own if you used a different path)
    cd /srv/funkwhale/data

    # stop the funkwhale container
    docker stop funkwhale

    # backup the database files
    cp -r data/ ../postgres.bak

    # Upgrade the database
    docker run --rm \
        -v $(pwd)/data:/var/lib/postgresql/10/data \
        -v $(pwd)/upgraded-postgresql:/var/lib/postgresql/11/data \
        -e PGUSER=funkwhale \
        -e POSTGRES_INITDB_ARGS="-U funkwhale --locale C --encoding UTF8" \
        tianon/postgres-upgrade:10-to-11

    # replace the Postgres 10 files with Postgres 11 files
    mv data/ postgres-10
    mv upgraded-postgresql/ data

Once you have completed the Funkwhale upgrade with our regular instructions and everything works properly,
you can remove the backups/old files::

    sudo -u funkwhale -H bash
    cd /srv/funkwhale/data
    rm -rf ../postgres.bak
    rm -rf postgres-10

0.20.1 (2019-10-28)
-------------------

Upgrade instructions are available at
https://docs.funkwhale.audio/index.html


Denormalized audio permission logic in a separate table to enhance performance
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

With this release, we're introducing a performance enhancement that should reduce the load on the database and API
servers (cf https://dev.funkwhale.audio/funkwhale/funkwhale/merge_requests/939).

Under the hood, we now maintain a separate table to link users to the tracks they are allowed to see. This change is **disabled**
by default, but should be enabled by default starting in Funkwhale 0.21.

If you want to try it now, add
``MUSIC_USE_DENORMALIZATION=True`` to your ``.env`` file, restart Funkwhale, and run the following command::

    python manage.py rebuild_music_permissions

This shouldn't cause any regression, but we'd appreciate if you could test this before the 0.21 release and report any unusual
behaviour regarding tracks, albums and artists visibility.


Enhancements:

- Added a retry option for failed uploads (#942)
- Added feedback via loading spinner when searching a remote library
- Denormalized audio permission logic in a separate table to enhance performance
- Placeholders will now be shown if no content is available across the application (#750)
- Reduce the number of simultaneous DB connections under some deployment scenario
- Support byYear filtering in Subsonic API (#936)


Bugfixes:

- Ensure password input doesn't overflow outside of container (#933)
- Fix audio serving issues under S3/nginx when signatures are enabled
- Fix import crash when importing M4A file with no embedded cover (#946)
- Fix tag exclusion in custom radios (#950)
- Fixed an issue with embed player CSS being purged during build (#935)
- Fixed escaped pod name displayed on home/about page (#945)
- Fixed pagination in subsonic getSongsByGenre endpoint (#954)
- Fixed style glitches in dropdowns


Documentation:

- Documented how to create DB extension by hand in case of permission error during migrations (#934)

0.20 (2019-10-04)
-----------------

Upgrade instructions are available at
https://docs.funkwhale.audio/index.html


Support for genres via tags
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

One of our most requested missing features is now available!

Starting with Funkwhale 0.20,
Funkwhale will automatically extract genre information from uploaded files and associate it
with the corresponding tracks in the form of tags (similar to Mastodon or Twitter hashtags).
Please refer to `our tagging documentation <https://docs.funkwhale.audio/users/upload.html#tagging-files>`_
for more information regarding the tagging process.

Tags can also be associated with artists and albums, and updated after upload through the UI using
the edit system released in Funkwhale 0.19. Tags are also fetched when retrieving content
via federation.

Tags are used in various places to enhance user experience:

- Tags are listed on tracks, albums and artist profiles
- Each tag has a dedicated page were you can browse corresponding content and quickly start a radio
- The custom radio builder now supports using tags
- Subsonic apps that support genres - such as DSub or Ultrasonic - should display this information as well

If you are a pod admin and want to extract tags from already uploaded content, you run `this snippet <https://dev.funkwhale.audio/funkwhale/funkwhale/snippets/43>`_
and `this snippet <https://dev.funkwhale.audio/funkwhale/funkwhale/snippets/44>`_ in a ``python manage.py shell``.

Content and account reports
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It is now possible to report content, such as artists, tracks or libraries, as well as user accounts. Such reports are forwarded to the pod moderators,
who can review it and delete reported content, block accounts or take any other action they deem necessary.

By default, both anonymous and authenticated users can submit these reports. This makes sure moderators can receive and handle
takedown requests and other reports for illegal content that may be sent by third-parties without an account on the pod. However,
you can disable anonymous reports completely via your pod settings.

Federation of the reports will be supported in a future release.

For more information about this feature, please check out our documentation:

-  `User documentation <https://docs.funkwhale.audio/moderator/reports.html>`_
-  `Moderator documentation <https://docs.funkwhale.audio/users/reports.html>`_

Account deletion
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Users can now delete their account themselves, without involving an administrator.

The deletion process will remove any local data and objects associated with the account,
but the username won't be able to new users to avoid impersonation. Deletion is also broadcasted
to other known servers on the federation.

For more information about this feature, please check out our documentation:

-  `User documentation <https://docs.funkwhale.audio/users/account.html>`_

Landing and about page redesign [Manual action suggested]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In this release, we've completely redesigned the landing and about page, by making it more useful and adapted to your pod
configuration. Among other things, the landing page will now include:

- your pod and an excerpt from your pod's description
- your pod banner image, if any
- your contact email, if any
- the login form
- the signup form (if registrations are open on your pod)
- some basic statistics about your pod
- a widget including recently uploaded albums, if anonymous access is enabled

The landing page will still include some information about Funkwhale, but in a less intrusive and proeminent way than before.

Additionally, the about page now includes:

- your pod name, description, rules and terms
- your pod banner image, if any
- your contact email, if any
- comprehensive statistics about your pod
- some info about your pod configuration, such as registration and federation status or the default upload quota for new users

With this redesign, we've added a handful of additional pod settings:

- Pod banner image
- Contact email
- Rules
- Terms of service

We recommend taking a few moments to fill these accordingly to your needs, by visiting ``/manage/settings``.

Allow-list to restrict federation to trusted domains
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Allow-Listing feature grants pod moderators
and administrators greater control over federation
by allowing you to create a pod-wide allow-list.

When allow-listing is enabled, your pod's users will only
be able to interact with pods included in the allow-list.
Any messages, activity, uploads, or modifications to
libraries and playlists will only be shared with pods
on the allow-list. Pods which are not included in the
allow-list will not have access to your pod's content
or messages and will not be able to send anything to
your pod.

If you want to enable this feature on your pod, or learn more, please refer to `our documentation <https://docs.funkwhale.audio/moderator/listing.html>`_!

Periodic message to incite people to support their pod and Funkwhale
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Users will now be reminded on a regular basis that they can help Funkwhale by donating or contributing.

If specified by the pod admin, a separate and custom message will also be displayed in a similar way to provide instructions and links to support the pod.

Both messages will appear for the first time 15 days after signup, in the notifications tab. For each message, users can schedule a reminder for a later time, or disable the messages entirely.


Replaced Daphne by Gunicorn/Uvicorn [manual action required, non-docker only]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To improve the performance, stability and reliability of Funkwhale's web processes,
we now recommend using Gunicorn and Uvicorn instead of Daphne. This combination unlock new use cases such as:

- zero-downtime upgrades
- configurable number of web worker processes

Based on our benchmarks, Gunicorn/Unicorn is also faster and more stable under higher workloads compared to Daphne.

To benefit from this enhancement on existing instances, you need to add ``FUNKWHALE_WEB_WORKERS=1`` in your ``.env`` file
(use a higher number if you want to have more web worker processes).

Then, edit your ``/etc/systemd/system/funkwhale-server.service`` and replace the ``ExecStart=`` line with
``ExecStart=/srv/funkwhale/virtualenv/bin/gunicorn config.asgi:application -w ${FUNKWHALE_WEB_WORKERS} -k uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker -b ${FUNKWHALE_API_IP}:${FUNKWHALE_API_PORT}``

Then reload the configuration change with ``sudo systemctl daemon-reload`` and ``sudo systemctl restart funkwhale-server``.


Content-Security-Policy and additional security headers [manual action suggested]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To improve the security and reduce the attack surface in case of a successfull exploit, we suggest
you add the following Content-Security-Policy to your nginx configuration.

..note::

    If you are using an S3-compatible store to serve music, you will need to specify the URL of your S3 store in the ``media-src`` and ``img-src`` headers

    .. code-block::

        add_header Content-Security-Policy "...img-src 'self' https://<your-s3-URL> data:;...media-src https://<your-s3-URL> 'self' data:";

**On non-docker setups**, in ``/etc/nginx/sites-available/funkwhale.conf``::

    server {

        add_header Content-Security-Policy "default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; img-src 'self' data:; font-src 'self' data:; object-src 'none'; media-src 'self' data:";
        add_header Referrer-Policy "strict-origin-when-cross-origin";

        location /front/ {
            add_header Content-Security-Policy "default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; img-src 'self' data:; font-src 'self' data:; object-src 'none'; media-src 'self' data:";
            add_header Referrer-Policy "strict-origin-when-cross-origin";
            add_header X-Frame-Options "SAMEORIGIN";
            # … existing content here
        }

        # Also create a new location for the embeds to ensure external iframes work
        # Simply copy-paste the /front/ location, but replace the following lines:
        location /front/embed.html {
            add_header X-Frame-Options "ALLOW";
            alias ${FUNKWHALE_FRONTEND_PATH}/embed.html;
        }
    }

Then reload nginx with ``systemctl reload nginx``.

**On docker setups**, in ``/srv/funkwhalenginx/funkwhale.template``::

    server {

        add_header Content-Security-Policy "default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; img-src 'self' data:; font-src 'self' data:; object-src 'none'; media-src 'self' data:";
        add_header Referrer-Policy "strict-origin-when-cross-origin";

        location /front/ {
            add_header Content-Security-Policy "default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; img-src 'self' data:; font-src 'self' data:; object-src 'none'; media-src 'self' data:";
            add_header Referrer-Policy "strict-origin-when-cross-origin";
            add_header X-Frame-Options "SAMEORIGIN";
            # … existing content here
        }

        # Also create a new location for the embeds to ensure external iframes work
        # Simply copy-paste the /front/ location, but replace the following lines:
        location /front/embed.html {
            add_header X-Frame-Options "ALLOW";
            alias /frontent/embed.html;
        }
    }

Then reload nginx with ``docker-compose restart nginx``.

Rate limiting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

With this release, rate-limiting on the API is enabled by default, with high enough limits to ensure
regular users of the app aren't affected. Requests beyond allowed limits are answered with a 429 HTTP error.

For anonymous requests, the limit is applied to the IP adress of the client, and for authenticated requests, the limit
is applied to the corresponding user account. By default, anonymous requests get a lower limit than authenticated requests.

You can disable the rate-limiting feature by adding `THROTTLING_ENABLED=false` to your ``.env`` file and restarting the
services. If you are using the Funkwhale API in your project or app and want to know more about the limits, please consult https://docs.funkwhale.audio/swagger/.

Broken audio streaming when using S3/Minio and DSub [manual action required]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some Subsonic clients, such as DSub, are sending an Authorization headers which was forwarded
to the S3 storage when streaming, causing some issues. If you are using S3 or a compatible storage
such as Minio, please add the following in your nginx ``~ /_protected/media/(.+)`` location::

    # Needed to ensure DSub auth isn't forwarded to S3/Minio, see #932
    proxy_set_header Authorization "";

And reload your nginx process.

0.19.0 (2019-05-16)
-------------------

Upgrade instructions are available at
https://docs.funkwhale.audio/admin/upgrading.html


Edits on tracks, albums and artists
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Funkwhale was a bit annoying when it camed to metadata. Tracks, albums and artists profiles
were created from audio file tags, but basically immutable after that (unless you had
admin access to Django's UI, which wasn't ideal to do this kind of changes).

With this release, everyone can suggest changes on track, album and artist pages. Users
with the "library" permission can review suggested edits in a dedicated interface
and apply/reject them.

Approved edits are broadcasted via federation, to ensure other instances get the information
too.

Not all fields are currently modifiable using this feature. Especially, it's not possible
to suggest a new album cover, or reassign a track to a different album or artist. Those will
be implemented in a future release.

Admin UI for tracks, albums, artists, libraries and uploads
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As part of our ongoing effort to make Funkwhale easier to manage for instance owners,
this release includes a brand new administration interface to deal with:

- tracks
- albums
- artists
- libraries
- uploads

You can use this UI to quickly search for any object, delete objects in batch, understand
where they are coming from etc. This new UI should remove the need to go through Django's
admin in the vast majority of cases (but also includes a link to Django's admin when needed).

Artist hiding in the interface
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It's now possible for users to hide artists they don't want to see.

Content linked to hidden artists will not show up in the interface anymore. Especially:

- Hidden artists tracks are removed from the current queue
- Starting a playlist will skip tracks from hidden artists
- Recently favorited, recently listened and recently added widgets on the homepage won't include content from hidden artists
- Radio suggestions will exclude tracks from hidden artists
- Hidden artists won't appear in Subsonic apps

Results linked to hidden artists will continue to show up in search results and their profile page remains accessible.

OAuth2 authorization for better integration with third-party apps
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Funkwhale now support the OAuth2 authorization and authentication protocol which will allow
third-party apps to interact with Funkwhale on behalf of users.

This feature makes it possible to build third-party apps that have the same capabilities
as Funkwhale's Web UI. The only exception at the moment is for actions that requires
special permissions, such as modifying instance settings or moderation (but this will be
enabled in a future release).

If you want to start building an app on top of Funkwhale's API, please check-out
`https://docs.funkwhale.audio/api.html`_ and `https://docs.funkwhale.audio/developers/authentication.html`_.

Better error handling and display during import
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Funkwhale should now be more resilient to missing tags in imported files, and give
you more insights when something goes wrong, including the specific tags that were missing
or invalid, and additional debug information to share in your support requests.

This information is available in all pages that list uploads, when clicking on the button next to the upload status.

Support for S3-compatible storages to store media files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Storing all media files on the Funkwhale server itself may not be possible or desirable
in all scenarios. You can now configure Funkwhale to store those files in a S3
bucket instead.

Check-out `https://docs.funkwhale.audio/admin/external-storages.html`_ if you want to use
this feature.

Prune library command
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Users are often surprised by Funkwhale's tendency to keep track, album and artist
metadata even if no associated files exist.

To help with that, we now offer a ``prune_library`` management command you can run
to purge your database from obsolete entries. `Please refer to our documentation
for usage instructions <https://docs.funkwhale.audio/admin/commands.html#pruning-library>`_.

Check in-place files command
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When using in-place import with a living audio library, you'll quite often rename or
remove files from the file system. Unfortunately, Funkwhale keeps a reference to those
files in the database, which results in unplayable tracks.

To help with that, we now offer a ``check_inplace_files`` management command you can run
to purge your database from obsolete files. `Please refer to our documentation
for usage instructions <https://docs.funkwhale.audio/admin/commands.html#remove-obsolete-files-from-database>`_.

0.18.3 (2019-03-21)
-------------------

Upgrade instructions are available at
https://docs.funkwhale.audio/admin/upgrading.html


Avoid mixed content when deploying mono-container behind proxy [Manual action required]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*You are only concerned if you use the mono-container docker deployment behind a reverse proxy*

Because of `an issue in our mono-container configuration <https://github.com/thetarkus/docker-funkwhale/issues/19>`_, users deploying Funkwhale via docker
using our `funkwhale/all-in-one` image could face some mixed content warnings (and possibly other troubles)
when browsing the Web UI.

This is fixed in this release, but on existing deployments, you'll need to add ``NESTED_PROXY=1`` in your container
environment (either in your ``.env`` file, or via your container management tool), then recreate your funkwhale container.


Enhancements:

- Added title on hover for truncated content (#766)
- Ask for confirmation before leaving upload page if there is a an upload in process (#630)
- Exclude in-place imported files from quota computation (#570)
- Truncate filename in library file table to ensure correct display of the table. (#735)


Bugfixes:

- Avoid mixed content when deploying mono-container behind HTTPS proxy (thetarkus/docker-funkwhale#19)
- Display new notifications immediatly on notifications page (#729)
- Ensure cover art from uploaded files is picked up properly on existing albums (#757)
- Fixed a crash when federating a track with unspecified position
- Fixed broken Activity and Actor modules in django admin (#767)
- Fixed broken sample apache configuration (#764)
- Fixed constant and unpredictable reordering during file upload (#716)
- Fixed delivering of local activities causing unintended side effects, such as rollbacking changes (#737)
- Fixed escaping issues in translated strings (#652)
- Fixed saving moderation policy when clicking on "Cancel" (#751)
- i18n: Update page title when changing the App's language. (#511)
- Include disc number in Subsonic responses (#765)
- Do not send notification when rejecting a follow on a local library (#743)


Documentation:

- Added documentation on mono-container docker upgrade (#713)
- Added documentation to set up let's encrypt certificate (#745)


0.18.2 (2019-02-13)
-------------------

Upgrade instructions are available at
https://docs.funkwhale.audio/admin/upgrading.html

Enhancements:

- Added a 'fix_federation_ids' management command to deal with protocol/domain issues in federation
  IDs after deployments (#706)
- Can now use a local file with FUNKWHALE_SPA_HTML_ROOT to avoid sending an HTTP request (#705)


Bugfixes:

- Downgraded channels dependency to 2.1.6 to fix denied uploads (#697)
- Fixed cards display issues on medium/small screens (#707)
- Fixed Embed component name that could lead to issue when developping on OSX (#696)

0.18.1 (2019-01-29)
-------------------

Upgrade instructions are available at
https://docs.funkwhale.audio/admin/upgrading.html


Fix Gzip compression to avoid BREACH exploit [security] [manual action required]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the 0.18 release, we've enabled Gzip compression by default for various
content types, including HTML and JSON. Unfortunately, enabling Gzip compression
on such content types could make BREACH-type exploits possible.

We've removed the risky content-types from our nginx template files, to ensure new
instances are safe, however, if you already have an instance, you need
to double check that your host nginx virtualhost do not include the following
values for the ``gzip_types`` settings::

   application/atom+xml
   application/json
   application/ld+json
   application/activity+json
   application/manifest+json
   application/rss+xml
   application/xhtml+xml
   application/xml

For convenience, you can also replace the whole setting with the following snippet::

   gzip_types
      application/javascript
      application/vnd.geo+json
      application/vnd.ms-fontobject
      application/x-font-ttf
      application/x-web-app-manifest+json
      font/opentype
      image/bmp
      image/svg+xml
      image/x-icon
      text/cache-manifest
      text/css
      text/plain
      text/vcard
      text/vnd.rim.location.xloc
      text/vtt
      text/x-component
      text/x-cross-domain-policy;

Many thanks to @jibec for the report!

Fix Apache configuration file for 0.18 [manual action required]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The way front is served has changed since 0.18. The Apache configuration can't serve 0.18 properly, leading to blank screens.

If you are on an Apache setup, you will have to replace the `<Location "/api">` block with the following::

   <Location "/">
      # similar to nginx 'client_max_body_size 100M;'
      LimitRequestBody 104857600

      ProxyPass ${funkwhale-api}/
      ProxyPassReverse ${funkwhale-api}/
   </Location>

And add some more `ProxyPass` directives so that the `Alias` part of your configuration file looks this way::

   ProxyPass "/front" "!"
   Alias /front /srv/funkwhale/front/dist

   ProxyPass "/media" "!"
   Alias /media /srv/funkwhale/data/media

   ProxyPass "/staticfiles" "!"
   Alias /staticfiles /srv/funkwhale/data/static

In case you are using custom css and theming, you also need to match this block::

   ProxyPass "/settings.json" "!"
   Alias /settings.json /srv/funkwhale/custom/settings.json

   ProxyPass "/custom" "!"
   Alias /custom /srv/funkwhale/custom


Enhancements:

- Added name attributes on all inputs to improve UX, especially with password managers (#686)
- Disable makemigrations in production and misleading message when running migrate (#685)
- Display progress during file upload
- Hide pagination when there is only one page of results (#681)
- Include shared/public playlists in Subsonic API responses (#684)
- Use proper locale for date-related/duration strings (#670)

- Fixed celery worker defaulting to development settings instead of production
- Fixed crashing Django admin when loading track detail page (#666)
- Fixed list icon alignement on landing page (#668)
- Fixed overescaping issue in notifications and album page (#676)
- Fixed wrong number of affected elements in bulk action modal (#683)
- Fixed wrong URL in documentation for funkwhale_proxy.conf file when deploying using Docker

- Removed potential BREACH exploit because of Gzip compression (#678)
- Upgraded kombu to fix an incompatibility with redis>=3


Documentation:

- Added user upload documentation at https://docs.funkwhale.audio/users/upload.html


0.18 "Naomi" (2019-01-22)
-------------------------

This release is dedicated to Naomi, an early contributor and beta tester of Funkwhale.
Her positivity, love and support have been incredibly helpful and helped shape the project
as you can enjoy it today. Thank you so much Naomi <3

Many thanks to the dozens of people that contributed to this release: translators, developers,
bug hunters, admins and backers. You made it possible!

Upgrade instructions are available at
https://docs.funkwhale.audio/admin/upgrading.html, ensure you also execute the intructions
marked with ``[manual action required]`` and ``[manual action suggested]``.

See ``Full changelog`` below for an exhaustive list of changes!

Audio transcoding is back!
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

After removal of our first, buggy transcoding implementation, we're proud to announce
that this feature is back. It is enabled by default, and can be configured/disabled
in your instance settings!

This feature works in the browser, with federated/non-federated tracks and using Subsonic clients.
Transcoded tracks are generated on the fly, and cached for a configurable amount of time,
to reduce the load on the server.


Licensing and copyright information
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Funkwhale is now able to parse copyright and license data from file and store
this information. Apart from displaying it on each track detail page,
no additional behaviour is currently implemented to use this new data, but this
will change in future releases.

License and copyright data is also broadcasted over federation.

License matching is done on the content of the ``License`` tag in the files,
with a fallback on the ``Copyright`` tag.

Funkwhale will successfully extract licensing data for the following licenses:

- Creative Commons 0 (Public Domain)
- Creative Commons 1.0 (All declinations)
- Creative Commons 2.0 (All declinations)
- Creative Commons 2.5 (All declinations and countries)
- Creative Commons 3.0 (All declinations and countries)
- Creative Commons 4.0 (All declinations)

Support for other licenses such as Art Libre or WTFPL will be added in future releases.


Instance-level moderation tools
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This release includes a first set of moderation tools that will give more control
to admins about the way their instance federates with other instance and accounts on the network.
Using these tools, it's now possible to:

- Browse known accounts and domains, and associated data (storage size, software version, etc.)
- Purge data belonging to given accounts and domains
- Block or partially restrict interactions with any account or domain

All those features are usable using a brand new "moderation" permission, meaning
you can appoint one or multiple moderators to help with this task.

I'd like to thank all Mastodon contributors, because some of the these tools are heavily
inspired from what's being done in Mastodon. Thank you so much!


Iframe widget to embed public tracks and albums [manual action required]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Funkwhale now supports embedding a lightweight audio player on external websites
for album and tracks that are available in public libraries. Important pages,
such as artist, album and track pages also include OpenGraph tags that will
enable previews on compatible apps (like sharing a Funkwhale track link on Mastodon
or Twitter).

To achieve that, we had to tweak the way Funkwhale front-end is served. You'll have
to modify your nginx configuration when upgrading to keep your instance working.

**On docker setups**, edit your ``/srv/funkwhale/nginx/funkwhale.template`` and replace
the ``location /api/`` and `location /` blocks by the following snippets::

    location / {
        include /etc/nginx/funkwhale_proxy.conf;
        # this is needed if you have file import via upload enabled
        client_max_body_size ${NGINX_MAX_BODY_SIZE};
        proxy_pass   http://funkwhale-api/;
    }

    location /front/ {
        alias /frontend/;
    }

The change of configuration will be picked when restarting your nginx container.

**On non-docker setups**, edit your ``/etc/nginx/sites-available/funkwhale.conf`` file,
and replace the ``location /api/`` and `location /` blocks by the following snippets::


    location / {
        include /etc/nginx/funkwhale_proxy.conf;
        # this is needed if you have file import via upload enabled
        client_max_body_size ${NGINX_MAX_BODY_SIZE};
        proxy_pass   http://funkwhale-api/;
    }

    location /front/ {
        alias ${FUNKWHALE_FRONTEND_PATH}/;
    }

Replace ``${FUNKWHALE_FRONTEND_PATH}`` by the corresponding variable from your .env file,
which should be ``/srv/funkwhale/front/dist`` by default, then reload your nginx process with
``sudo systemctl reload nginx``.


Alternative docker deployment method
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Thanks to the awesome work done by @thetarkus at https://github.com/thetarkus/docker-funkwhale,
we're now able to provide an alternative and easier Docker deployment method!

In contrast with our current, multi-container offer, this method integrates
all Funkwhale processes and services (database, redis, etc.) into a single, easier to deploy container.

Both methods will coexist in parallel, as each one has pros and cons. You can learn more
about this exciting new deployment option by visiting https://docs.funkwhale.audio/installation/docker.html!

Automatically load .env file
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

On non-docker deployments, earlier versions required you to source
the config/.env file before launching any Funkwhale command, with ``export $(cat config/.env | grep -v ^# | xargs)``
This led to more complex and error prone deployment / setup.

This is not the case anymore, and Funkwhale will automatically load this file if it's available.


Delete pre 0.17 federated tracks [manual action suggested]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you were using Funkwhale before the 0.17 release and federated with other instances,
it's possible that you still have some unplayable federated files in the database.

To purge the database of those entries, you can run the following command:

On docker setups::

    docker-compose run --rm api python manage.py script delete_pre_017_federated_uploads --no-input

On non-docker setups::

    python manage.py script delete_pre_017_federated_uploads --no-input


Enable gzip compression [manual action suggested]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Gzip compression will be enabled on new instances by default
and will reduce the amount of bandwidth consumed by your instance.

If you want to benefit from gzip compression on your instance,
edit your reverse proxy virtualhost file (located at ``/etc/nginx/sites-available/funkwhale.conf``) and add the following snippet
in the server block, then reload your nginx server::

    server {
        # ... exiting configuration

        # compression settings
        gzip on;
        gzip_comp_level    5;
        gzip_min_length    256;
        gzip_proxied       any;
        gzip_vary          on;

        gzip_types
            application/javascript
            application/vnd.geo+json
            application/vnd.ms-fontobject
            application/x-font-ttf
            application/x-web-app-manifest+json
            font/opentype
            image/bmp
            image/svg+xml
            image/x-icon
            text/cache-manifest
            text/css
            text/plain
            text/vcard
            text/vnd.rim.location.xloc
            text/vtt
            text/x-component
            text/x-cross-domain-policy;
        # end of compression settings
    }

Using a LDAP directory to authenticate to your Funkwhale instance
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Funkwhale now support LDAP as an authentication source: you can configure
your instance to delegate login to a LDAP directory, which is especially
useful when you have an existing directory and don't want to manage users
manually.

You can use this authentication backend side by side with the classic one.

Have a look at https://docs.funkwhale.audio/installation/ldap.html
for detailed instructions on how to set this up.


Simplified nginx setup [Docker: Manual action required]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We've received a lot of user feedback regarding our installation process,
and it seems the proxy part is the one which is the most confusing and difficult.
Unfortunately, this is also the one where errors and mistakes can completely break
the application.

To make things easier for everyone, we now offer a simplified deployment
process for the reverse proxy part. This will make upgrade of the proxy configuration
significantly easier on docker deployments.

On non-docker instances, you have nothing to do.

If you have a dockerized instance, here is the upgrade path.

First, tweak your .env file::

    # remove the FUNKWHALE_URL variable
    # and add the next variables
    FUNKWHALE_HOSTNAME=yourdomain.funkwhale
    FUNKWHALE_PROTOCOL=https

    # add the following variable, matching the path your app is deployed
    # leaving the default should work fine if you deployed using the same
    # paths as the documentation
    FUNKWHALE_FRONTEND_PATH=/srv/funkwhale/front/dist

Then, add the following block at the end of your docker-compose.yml file::

    # existing services
    api:
        ...
    celeryworker:
        ...

    # new service
    nginx:
      image: nginx
      env_file:
        - .env
      environment:
        # Override those variables in your .env file if needed
        - "NGINX_MAX_BODY_SIZE=${NGINX_MAX_BODY_SIZE-100M}"
      volumes:
        - "./nginx/funkwhale.template:/etc/nginx/conf.d/funkwhale.template:ro"
        - "./nginx/funkwhale_proxy.conf:/etc/nginx/funkwhale_proxy.conf:ro"
        - "${MUSIC_DIRECTORY_SERVE_PATH-/srv/funkwhale/data/music}:${MUSIC_DIRECTORY_SERVE_PATH-/srv/funkwhale/data/music}:ro"
        - "${MEDIA_ROOT}:${MEDIA_ROOT}:ro"
        - "${STATIC_ROOT}:${STATIC_ROOT}:ro"
        - "${FUNKWHALE_FRONTEND_PATH}:/frontend:ro"
      ports:
        # override those variables in your .env file if needed
        - "${FUNKWHALE_API_IP}:${FUNKWHALE_API_PORT}:80"
      command: >
          sh -c "envsubst \"`env | awk -F = '{printf \" $$%s\", $$1}'`\"
          < /etc/nginx/conf.d/funkwhale.template
          > /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf
          && cat /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf
          && nginx -g 'daemon off;'"
      links:
        - api

By doing that, you'll enable a dockerized nginx that will automatically be
configured to serve your Funkwhale instance.

Download the required configuration files for the nginx container:

.. parsed-literal::

    cd /srv/funkwhale
    mkdir nginx
    curl -L -o nginx/funkwhale.template "https://dev.funkwhale.audio/funkwhale/funkwhale/raw/|version|/deploy/docker.nginx.template"
    curl -L -o nginx/funkwhale_proxy.conf "https://dev.funkwhale.audio/funkwhale/funkwhale/raw/|version|/deploy/funkwhale_proxy.conf"

Update the funkwhale.conf configuration of your server's reverse-proxy::

    # the file should match something like that, upgrade all variables
    # between ${} to match the ones in your .env file,
    # and your SSL configuration if you're not using let's encrypt
    # The important thing is that you only have a single location block
    # that proxies everything to your dockerized nginx.

    sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/funkwhale.conf
    upstream fw {
        # depending on your setup, you may want to update this
        server ${FUNKWHALE_API_IP}:${FUNKWHALE_API_PORT};
    }
    map $http_upgrade $connection_upgrade {
        default upgrade;
        ''      close;
    }

    server {
        listen 80;
        listen [::]:80;
        server_name ${FUNKWHALE_HOSTNAME};
        location / { return 301 https://$host$request_uri; }
    }
    server {
        listen      443 ssl;
        listen [::]:443 ssl;
        server_name ${FUNKWHALE_HOSTNAME};

        # TLS
        ssl_protocols TLSv1.2;
        ssl_ciphers HIGH:!MEDIUM:!LOW:!aNULL:!NULL:!SHA;
        ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;
        ssl_session_cache shared:SSL:10m;
        ssl_certificate     /etc/letsencrypt/live/${FUNKWHALE_HOSTNAME}/fullchain.pem;
        ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/${FUNKWHALE_HOSTNAME}/privkey.pem;

        # HSTS
        add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000";

        location / {
            include /etc/nginx/funkwhale_proxy.conf;
            proxy_pass   http://fw/;
        }
    }

Check that your configuration is valid then reload:

    sudo nginx -t
    sudo systemctl reload nginx

Library home and playlist page overhaul
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The library home page have been completely redesigned to include:

- other users activity (listenings, playlists and favorites)
- recently imported albums

We think this new version showcases more music in a more useful way, let us know
what you think about it!

The playlist page have been updated as well.


Internationalized interface
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

After months of work, we're proud to announce our interface is now ready
for internationalization.

Translators have already started the work of translating Funkwhale in 8 different languages,
and we're ready to add more as needed.

You can easily get involved at https://translate.funkwhale.audio/engage/funkwhale/


Better handling of tracks with a different artist than the album artist
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some tracks involve a different artist than the album artist (e.g. a featuring)
and Funkwhale has been known to do weird things when importing such tracks, resulting
in albums that contained a single track, for instance.

The situation should be improved with this release, as Funkwhale is now able to
store separately the track and album artist, and display it properly in the interface.


Users now have an ActivityPub Actor [Manual action required]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the process of implementing federation for user activity such as listening
history, we are now making user profiles (a.k.a. ActivityPub actors) available through federation.

This does not means the federation is working, but this is a needed step to implement it.

Those profiles will be created automatically for new users, but you have to run a command
to create them for existing users.

On docker setups::

    docker-compose run --rm api python manage.py script create_actors --no-input

On non-docker setups::

    python manage.py script create_actors --no-input

This should only take a few seconds to run. It is safe to interrupt the process or rerun it multiple times.


Image thumbnails [Manual action required]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To reduce bandwidth usage on slow or limited connexions and improve performance
in general, we now use smaller images in the front-end. For instance, if you have
an album cover with a 1000x1000 pixel size, we will create smaller
versions of this image (50x50, 200x200, 400x400) and reference those resized version
when we don't actually need the original image.

Thumbnail will be created automatically for new objects, however, you have
to launch a manual command to deal with existing ones.

On docker setups::

    docker-compose run --rm api python manage.py script create_image_variations --no-input

On non-docker setups::

    python manage.py script create_image_variations --no-input

This should be quite fast but may take up to a few minutes depending on the number
of albums you have in database. It is safe to interrupt the process or rerun it multiple times.


Improved search on federated tracks list
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Having a powerful but easy-to-use search is important but difficult to achieve, especially
if you do not want to have a real complex search interface.

Github does a pretty good job with that, using a structured but simple query system
(See https://help.github.com/articles/searching-issues-and-pull-requests/#search-only-issues-or-pull-requests).

This release implements a limited but working subset of this query system. You can use it only on the federated
tracks list (/manage/federation/tracks) at the moment, but depending on feedback it will be rolled-out on other pages as well.

This is the type of query you can run:

- ``hello world``: search for "hello" and "world" in all the available fields
- ``hello in:artist`` search for results where artist name is "hello"
- ``spring in:artist,album`` search for results where artist name or album title contain "spring"
- ``artist:hello`` search for results where artist name equals "hello"
- ``artist:"System of a Down" domain:instance.funkwhale`` search for results where artist name equals "System of a Down" and inside "instance.funkwhale" library


Ensure MEDIA_ROOT, STATIC_ROOT and MUSIC_DIRECTORY_* are set explicitely [Manual action required]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In our default .env file, MEDIA_ROOT and STATIC_ROOT were commented by default, causing
some deployment issues on non-docker setups when people forgot to uncomment them.

From now on, those variables are uncommented, and will also be used on docker setups
to mount the volumes automatically in the docker-compose.yml file. This has been a source
of headache as well in some deployments, where you had to update both the .env file and
the compose file.

This also applies to in-place paths (MUSIC_DIRECTORY_PATH and MUSIC_DIRECTORY_SERVE_PATH),
whose values are now used directly to set up the proper Docker volumes.

This will only affect new deployments though. If you want to benefit from this on an
existing instance, do a backup of your ``.env`` and ``docker-compose.yml`` files and apply the following changes:

- Ensure ``MEDIA_ROOT`` is uncommented in your .env file and match the absolute path where media files are stored
  on your host (``/srv/funkwhale/data/media`` by default)
- Ensure ``STATIC_ROOT`` is uncommented in your .env file and match the absolute path where static files are stored
  on your host (``/srv/funkwhale/data/static`` by default)
- If you use in-place import:
    - Ensure MUSIC_DIRECTORY_PATH is uncommented and set to ``/music``
    - Ensure MUSIC_DIRECTORY_SERVE_PATH is uncommented and set to the absolute path on your host were your music files
      are stored (``/srv/funkwhale/data/music`` by default)
- Edit your docker-compose.yml file to reflect the changes:
    - Search for volumes (there should be two occurences) that contains ``/app/funkwhale_api/media`` on the right side, and
      replace the whole line with ``- "${MEDIA_ROOT}:${MEDIA_ROOT}"``
    - Search for a volume that contains ``/app/staticfiles`` on the right side, and
      replace the whole line with ``- "${STATIC_ROOT}:${STATIC_ROOT}"``
    - If you use in-place import, search for volumes (there should be two occurences) that contains ``/music:ro`` on the right side, and
      replace the whole line with ``- "${MUSIC_DIRECTORY_SERVE_PATH}:${MUSIC_DIRECTORY_PATH}:ro"``

In the end, the ``volumes`` directives of your containers should look like that::

    ...
    celeryworker
      volumes:
        - "${MUSIC_DIRECTORY_SERVE_PATH}:${MUSIC_DIRECTORY_PATH}:ro"
        - "${MEDIA_ROOT}:${MEDIA_ROOT}"
    ...
    api:
      volumes:
        - "${MUSIC_DIRECTORY_SERVE_PATH}:${MUSIC_DIRECTORY_PATH}:ro"
        - "${MEDIA_ROOT}:${MEDIA_ROOT}"
        - "${STATIC_ROOT}:${STATIC_ROOT}"
        - ./front/dist:/frontend
    ...


Removed Cacheops dependency
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We removed one of our dependency named django-cacheops. It was unly used in a few places,
and not playing nice with other dependencies.

You can safely remove this dependency in your environment with ``pip uninstall django-cacheops`` if you're
not using docker.

You can also safely remove any ``CACHEOPS_ENABLED`` setting from your environment file.

- Upgrade documentation now use the correct user on non-docker setups (#265)


Invite system
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

On closed instances, it has always been a little bit painful to create accounts
by hand for new users. This release solve that by adding invitations.

You can generate invitation codes via the "users" admin interface (you'll find a
link in the sidebar). Those codes are valid for 14 days, and can be used once
to create a new account on the instance, even if registrations are closed.

By default, we generate a random code for invitations, but you can also use custom codes
if you need to print them or make them fancier ;)

Invitations generation and management requires the "settings" permission.


Removed front-end and back-end coupling
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Eventhough Funkwhale's front-end has always been a Single Page Application,
talking to an API, it was only able to talk to an API on the same domain.

There was no real technical justification behind this (only lazyness), and it was
also blocking interesting use cases:

- Use multiple customized versions of the front-end with the same instance
- Use a customized version of the front-end with multiple instances
- Use a locally hosted front-end with a remote API, which is especially useful in development

From now on, Funkwhale's front-end can connect to any Funkwhale server. You can
change the server you are connecting to in the footer.

Fixing this also unlocked a really interesting feature in our development/review workflow:
by leveraging Gitlab CI and review apps, we are now able to deploy automatically live versions of
a merge request, making it possible for anyone to review front-end changes easily, without
the need to install a local environment.

Permission issues on radios
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Because of an error in the way we checked user permissions on radios,
public radios could be deleted by any logged-in user, even if they were not
the owner of the radio.

We recommend instances owners to upgrade as fast as possible to avoid any abuse
and data loss.


Funkwhale is now licenced under AGPL-3
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Following the recent switch made by PixelFed
(https://github.com/dansup/pixelfed/issues/143), we decided along with
the community to relicence Funkwhale under the AGPL-3 licence. We did this
switch for various reasons:

- This is better aligned with other fediverse software
- It prohibits anyone to distribute closed-source and proprietary forks of Funkwhale

As end users and instance owners, this does not change anything. You can
continue to use Funkwhale exactly as you did before :)


Apache support for websocket
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Up until now, our Apache2 configuration was not working with websockets. This is now
solved by adding this at the beginning of your Apache2 configuration file::

    Define funkwhale-api-ws ws://localhost:5000

And this, before the "/api" block::

    # Activating WebSockets
    ProxyPass "/api/v1/instance/activity" ${funkwhale-api-ws}/api/v1/instance/activity

Websockets may not be supported in older versions of Apache2. Be sure to upgrade to the latest version available.


Serving album covers in https (Apache2 proxy)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Two issues are addressed here. The first one was about Django replying with
mixed content (http) when queried for covers. Setting up the `X-Forwarded-Proto`
allows Django to know that the client is using https, and that the reply must
be https as well.

Second issue was a problem of permission causing Apache a denied access to
album cover folder. It is solved by adding another block for this path in
the Apache configuration file for funkwhale.

Here is how to modify your `funkwhale.conf` apache2 configuration::

  <VirtualHost *:443>

    ...
    #Add this new line
    RequestHeader set X-Forwarded-Proto "https"
    ...
    # Add this new block below the other <Directory/> blocks
    # replace /srv/funkwhale/data/media with the path to your media directory
    # if you're not using the standard layout.
    <Directory /srv/funkwhale/data/media/albums>
      Options FollowSymLinks
      AllowOverride None
      Require all granted
    </Directory>
    ...
  </VirtualHost>


About the makemigrations warning
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You may sometimes get the following warning while applying migrations::

    "Your models have changes that are not yet reflected in a migration, and so won't be applied."

This is a warning, not an error, and it can be safely ignored.
Never run the ``makemigrations`` command yourself.

Removed alpha-state transcoding (#271)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A few months ago, a basic transcoding feature was implemented. Due to the way
this feature was designed, it was slow, CPU intensive on the server side,
and very tightly coupled to the reverse-proxy configuration, preventing
it to work Apache2, for instance. It was also not compatible with Subsonic clients.

Based on that, we're currently removing support for transcoding
**in its current state**. The work on a better designed transcoding feature
can be tracked in https://dev.funkwhale.audio/funkwhale/funkwhale/issues/272.

You don't have to do anything on your side, but you may want to remove
the now obsolete configuration from your reverse proxy file (nginx only)::

    # Remove those blocks:

    # transcode cache
    proxy_cache_path /tmp/funkwhale-transcode levels=1:2 keys_zone=transcode:10m max_size=1g inactive=7d;

    # Transcoding logic and caching
    location = /transcode-auth {
        include /etc/nginx/funkwhale_proxy.conf;
        # needed so we can authenticate transcode requests, but still
        # cache the result
        internal;
        set $query '';
        # ensure we actually pass the jwt to the underlytin auth url
        if ($request_uri ~* "[^\?]+\?(.*)$") {
            set $query $1;
        }
        proxy_pass http://funkwhale-api/api/v1/trackfiles/viewable/?$query;
        proxy_pass_request_body off;
        proxy_set_header        Content-Length "";
    }

    location /api/v1/trackfiles/transcode/ {
        include /etc/nginx/funkwhale_proxy.conf;
        # this block deals with authenticating and caching transcoding
        # requests. Caching is heavily recommended as transcoding
        # is a CPU intensive process.
        auth_request /transcode-auth;
        if ($args ~ (.*)jwt=[^&]*(.*)) {
            set $cleaned_args $1$2;
        }
        proxy_cache_key "$scheme$request_method$host$uri$is_args$cleaned_args";
        proxy_cache transcode;
        proxy_cache_valid 200 7d;
        proxy_ignore_headers "Set-Cookie";
        proxy_hide_header "Set-Cookie";
        add_header X-Cache-Status $upstream_cache_status;
        proxy_pass   http://funkwhale-api;
    }

Files management interface
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is the first bit of an ongoing work that will span several releases, to
bring more powerful library management features to Funkwhale. This iteration
includes a basic file management interface where users with the "library"
permission can list and search available files, order them using
various criterias (size, bitrate, duration...) and delete them.

New "upload" permission
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This new permission is helpful if you want to give upload/import rights
to some users, but don't want them to be able to manage the library as a whole:
although there are no controls yet for managing library in the fron-end,
subsequent release will introduce management interfaces for artists, files,
etc.

Because of that, users with the "library" permission will have much more power,
and will also be able to remove content from the platform. On the other hand,
users with the "upload" permission will only have the ability to add new
content.

Also, this release also includes a new feature called "default permissions":
those are permissions that are granted to every users on the platform.
On public/open instances, this will play well with the "upload" permission
since everyone will be able to contribute to the instance library without
an admin giving the permission to every single user.

Smarter album cover importer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In earlier versions, covers where only imported when launching a YouTube import.
Starting from this release, covers will be imported regardless of the import mode
(file upload, youtube-dl, CLI, in-place...). Funkwhale will look for covers
in the following order:

1. In the imported file itself (FLAC/MP3 only)
2. In a cover.jpg or cover.png in the file directory
3. By fetching cover art from Musibrainz, assuming the file is tagged correctly

This will only work for newly imported tracks and albums though. In the future,
we may offer an option to refetch album covers from the interface, but in the
meantime, you can use the following snippet:

.. code-block:: python

    # Store this in /tmp/update_albums.py
    from funkwhale_api.music.models import Album, TrackFile
    from funkwhale_api.music.tasks import update_album_cover

    albums_without_covers = Album.objects.filter(cover='')
    total = albums_without_covers.count()
    print('Found {} albums without cover'.format(total))
    for i, album in enumerate(albums_without_covers.iterator()):
        print('[{}/{}] Fetching cover for {}...'.format(i+1, total, album.title))
        f = TrackFile.objects.filter(track__album=album).filter(source__startswith='file://').first()
        update_album_cover(album, track_file=f)

Then launch it::

    # docker setups
    cat /tmp/update_albums.py | docker-compose run --rm api python manage.py shell -i python

    # non-docker setups
    source /srv/funkwhale/load_env
    source /srv/funkwhale/virtualenv/bin/activate
    cat /tmp/update_albums.py | python manage.py shell -i python

    # cleanup
    rm /tmp/update_albums.py

.. note::

    Depending on your number of albums, the previous snippet may take some time
    to execute. You can interrupt it at any time using ctrl-c and relaunch it later,
    as it's idempotent.

Music API changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This release includes an API break. Even though the API is advertised
as unstable, and not documented, here is a brief explanation of the change in
case you are using the API in a client or in a script. Summary of the changes:

- ``/api/v1/artists`` does not includes a list of tracks anymore. It was to heavy
  to return all of this data all the time. You can get all tracks for an
  artist using ``/api/v1/tracks?artist=artist_id``
- Additionally, ``/api/v1/tracks`` now support an ``album`` filter to filter
  tracks matching an album
- ``/api/v1/artists/search``, ``/api/v1/albums/search`` and ``/api/v1/tracks/search``
  endpoints are removed. Use ``/api/v1/{artists|albums|tracks}/?q=yourquery``
  instead. It's also more powerful, since you can combine search with other
  filters and ordering options.
- ``/api/v1/requests/import-requests/search`` endpoint is removed as well.
  Use ``/api/v1/requests/import-requests/?q=yourquery``
  instead. It's also more powerful, since you can combine search with other
  filters and ordering options.

Of course, the front-end was updated to work with the new API, so this should
not impact end-users in any way, apart from slight performance gains.

.. note::

    The API is still not stable and may evolve again in the future. API freeze
    will come at a later point.

Flac files imports via upload
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You have nothing to do to benefit from this, however, since Flac files
tend to be a lot bigger than other files, you may want to increase the
``client_max_body_size`` value in your Nginx configuration if you plan
to upload flac files.

Missing subsonic configuration bloc in vhost files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Because of a missing bloc in the sample Nginx and Apache configurations,
instances that were deployed after the 0.13 release are likely to be unable
to answer to Subsonic clients (the missing bits were properly documented
in the changelog).

Ensure you have the following snippets in your Nginx or Apache configuration
if you plan to use the Subsonic API.

Nginx::

    location /rest/ {
        include /etc/nginx/funkwhale_proxy.conf;
        proxy_pass   http://funkwhale-api/api/subsonic/rest/;
    }

Apache2::

    <Location "/rest">
        ProxyPass ${funkwhale-api}/api/subsonic/rest
        ProxyPassReverse ${funkwhale-api}/api/subsonic/rest
     </Location>


0.13 (2018-05-19)

Upgrade instructions are available at
  https://docs.funkwhale.audio/upgrading.html

Features:

- Can now import and play flac files (#157)
- Simpler permission system (#152)
- Store file length, size and bitrate (#195)
- We now have a brand new instance settings interface in the front-end (#206)


Enhancements:

- Disabled browsable HTML API in production (#205)
- Instances can now indicate on the nodeinfo endpoint if they want to remain
  private (#200)


Bugfixes:

  serving (#196)
- Removed Python 3.6 dependency (secrets module) (#198)
- Uplayable tracks are now properly disabled in the interface (#199)


Instance settings interface
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Prior to this release, the only way to update instance settings (such as
instance description, signup policy, federation configuration, etc.) was using
the admin interface provided by Django (the back-end framework which power the API).

This interface worked, but was not really-user friendly and intuitive.

Starting from this release, we now offer a dedicated interface directly
in the front-end. You can view and edit all your instance settings from here,
assuming you have the required permissions.

This interface is available at ``/manage/settings` and via link in the sidebar.


Storage of bitrate, size and length in database
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Starting with this release, when importing files, Funkwhale will store
additional information about audio files:

- Bitrate
- Size (in bytes)
- Duration

This change is not retroactive, meaning already imported files will lack those
informations. The interface and API should work as before in such case, however,
we offer a command to deal with legacy files and populate the missing values.

On docker setups:

.. code-block:: shell

    docker-compose run --rm api python manage.py fix_track_files


On non-docker setups:

.. code-block:: shell

    # from your activated virtualenv
    python manage.py fix_track_files

.. note::

    The execution time for this command is proportional to the number of
    audio files stored on your instance. This is because we need to read the
    files from disk to fetch the data. You can run it in the background
    while Funkwhale is up.

    It's also safe to interrupt this command and rerun it at a later point, or run
    it multiple times.

    Use the --dry-run flag to check how many files would be impacted.


Simpler permission system
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Starting from this release, the permission system is much simpler. Up until now,
we were using Django's built-in permission system, which was working, but also
quite complex to deal with.

The new implementation relies on simpler logic, which will make integration
on the front-end in upcoming releases faster and easier.

If you have manually given permissions to users on your instance,
you can migrate those to the new system.

On docker setups:

.. code-block:: shell

    docker-compose run --rm api python manage.py script django_permissions_to_user_permissions --no-input

On non-docker setups:

.. code-block:: shell

    # in your virtualenv
    python api/manage.py script django_permissions_to_user_permissions --no-input

There is still no dedicated interface to manage user permissions, but you
can use the admin interface at ``/api/admin/users/user/`` for that purpose in
the meantime.


0.12 (2018-05-09)
-----------------

Upgrade instructions are available at
  https://docs.funkwhale.audio/upgrading.html

Features:

- Subsonic API implementation to offer compatibility with existing clients such
  as DSub (#75)
- Use nodeinfo standard for publishing instance information (#192)


Enhancements:

- Play button now play tracks immediately instead of appending them to the
  queue (#99, #156)


Bugfixes:

- Fix broken federated import (#193)


Documentation:

- Up-to-date documentation for upgrading front-end files on docker setup (#132)


Subsonic API
^^^^^^^^^^^^

This release implements some core parts of the Subsonic API, which is widely
deployed in various projects and supported by numerous clients.

By offering this API in Funkwhale, we make it possible to access the instance
library and listen to the music without from existing Subsonic clients, and
without developping our own alternative clients for each and every platform.

Most advanced Subsonic clients support offline caching of music files,
playlist management and search, which makes them well-suited for nomadic use.

Please head over :doc:`users/apps` for more informations about supported clients
and user instructions.

At the instance-level, the Subsonic API is enabled by default, but require
and additional endpoint to be added in you reverse-proxy configuration.

On nginx, add the following block::

    location /rest/ {
        include /etc/nginx/funkwhale_proxy.conf;
        proxy_pass   http://funkwhale-api/api/subsonic/rest/;
    }

On Apache, add the following block::

    <Location "/rest">
        ProxyPass ${funkwhale-api}/api/subsonic/rest
        ProxyPassReverse ${funkwhale-api}/api/subsonic/rest
    </Location>

The Subsonic can be disabled at the instance level from the django admin.

.. note::

    Because of Subsonic's API design which assumes cleartext storing of
    user passwords, we chose to have a dedicated, separate password
    for that purpose. Users can generate this password from their
    settings page in the web client.


Nodeinfo standard for instance information and stats
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. warning::

    The ``/api/v1/instance/stats/`` endpoint which was used to display
    instance data in the about page is removed in favor of the new
    ``/api/v1/instance/nodeinfo/2.0/`` endpoint.

In earlier version, we where using a custom endpoint and format for
our instance information and statistics. While this was working,
this was not compatible with anything else on the fediverse.

We now offer a nodeinfo 2.0 endpoint which provides, in a single place,
all the instance information such as library and user activity statistics,
public instance settings (description, registration and federation status, etc.).

We offer two settings to manage nodeinfo in your Funkwhale instance:

1. One setting to completely disable nodeinfo, but this is not recommended
   as the exposed data may be needed to make some parts of the front-end
   work (especially the about page).
2. One setting to disable only usage and library statistics in the nodeinfo
   endpoint. This is useful if you want the nodeinfo endpoint to work,
   but don't feel comfortable sharing aggregated statistics about your library
   and user activity.

To make your instance fully compatible with the nodeinfo protocol, you need to
to edit your nginx configuration file::

    # before
    ...
    location /.well-known/webfinger {
        include /etc/nginx/funkwhale_proxy.conf;
        proxy_pass   http://funkwhale-api/.well-known/webfinger;
    }
    ...

    # after
    ...
    location /.well-known/ {
        include /etc/nginx/funkwhale_proxy.conf;
        proxy_pass   http://funkwhale-api/.well-known/;
    }
    ...

You can do the same if you use apache::

    # before
    ...
    <Location "/.well-known/webfinger">
      ProxyPass ${funkwhale-api}/.well-known/webfinger
      ProxyPassReverse ${funkwhale-api}/.well-known/webfinger
    </Location>
    ...

    # after
    ...
    <Location "/.well-known/">
      ProxyPass ${funkwhale-api}/.well-known/
      ProxyPassReverse ${funkwhale-api}/.well-known/
    </Location>
    ...

This will ensure all well-known endpoints are proxied to funkwhale, and
not just webfinger one.

0.11 (2018-05-06)
-----------------

Upgrade instructions are available at https://docs.funkwhale.audio/upgrading.html

Special thanks for this release go to @renon:matrix.org (@Hazmo on Gitlab)
for bringing Apache2 support to Funkwhale and contributing on other issues.
Thank you!

Features:

- Funkwhale now works behind an Apache2 reverse proxy (!165)
  check out the brand new documentation at https://docs.funkwhale.audio/installation/index.html#apache2
  if you want to try it!
- Users can now request password reset by email, assuming a SMTP server was
  correctly configured (#187)

Enhancements:

- Added a fix_track_files command to run checks and fixes against library
  (#183)
- Avoid fetching Actor object on every request authentication
- Can now relaunch errored jobs and batches (#176)
- List pending requests by default, added a status filter for requests (#109)
- More structured menus in sidebar, added labels with notifications
- Sample virtual-host file for Apache2 reverse-proxy (!165)
- Store high-level settings (such as federation or auth-related ones) in
  database (#186)


Bugfixes:

- Ensure in place imported files get a proper mimetype (#183)
- Federation cache suppression is now simpler and also deletes orphaned files
  (#189)
- Fixed small UI glitches/bugs in federation tabs (#184)
- X-sendfile not working with in place import (#182)


Documentation:

- Added a documentation area for third-party projects (#180)
- Added documentation for optimizing Funkwhale and reduce its memory footprint.
- Document that the database should use an utf-8 encoding (#185)
- Foundations for API documentation with Swagger (#178)


Database storage for high-level settings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Due to the work done in #186, the following environment variables have been
deprecated:

- FEDERATION_ENABLED
- FEDERATION_COLLECTION_PAGE_SIZE
- FEDERATION_MUSIC_NEEDS_APPROVAL
- FEDERATION_ACTOR_FETCH_DELAY
- PLAYLISTS_MAX_TRACKS
- API_AUTHENTICATION_REQUIRED

Configuration for this settings has been moved to database, as it will provide
a better user-experience, by allowing you to edit these values on-the-fly,
without restarting Funkwhale processes.

You can leave those environment variables in your .env file for now, as the
values will be used to populate the database entries. We'll make a proper
announcement when the variables won't be used anymore.

Please browse https://docs.funkwhale.audio/configuration.html#instance-settings
for more information about instance configuration using the web interface.


System emails
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Starting from this release, Funkwhale will send two types
of emails:

- Email confirmation emails, to ensure a user's email is valid
- Password reset emails, enabling user to reset their password without an admin's intervention

Email sending is disabled by default, as it requires additional configuration.
In this mode, emails are simply outputed on stdout.

If you want to actually send those emails to your users, you should edit your
.env file and tweak the EMAIL_CONFIG variable. See :ref:`setting-EMAIL_CONFIG`
for more details.

.. note::

  As a result of these changes, the DJANGO_EMAIL_BACKEND variable,
  which was not documented, has no effect anymore. You can safely remove it from
  your .env file if it is set.


Proxy headers for non-docker deployments
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For non-docker deployments, add ``--proxy-headers`` at the end of the ``daphne``
command in :file:`/etc/systemd/system/funkwhale-server.service`.

This will ensure the application receive the correct IP address from the client
and not the proxy's one.

In-place import
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This release includes in-place imports for the CLI import. This means you can
load gigabytes of music into funkwhale without worrying about about Funkwhale
copying those music files in its internal storage and eating your disk space.

`This new feature is documented here <https://docs.funkwhale.audio/importing-music.html#in-place-import>`_
and require additional configuration to ensure funkwhale and your webserver can
serve those files properly.

**Non-docker users:**

Assuming your music is stored in ``/srv/funkwhale/data/music``, add the following
block to your nginx configuration::

    location /_protected/music {
        internal;
        alias   /srv/funkwhale/data/music;
    }

And the following to your .env file::

    MUSIC_DIRECTORY_PATH=/srv/funkwhale/data/music

**Docker users:**

Assuming your music is stored in ``/srv/funkwhale/data/music``, add the following
block to your nginx configuration::

    location /_protected/music {
        internal;
        alias   /srv/funkwhale/data/music;
    }

Assuming you have the following volume directive in your ``docker-compose.yml``
(it's the default): ``/srv/funkwhale/data/music:/music:ro``, then add
the following to your .env file::

    # this is the path in the container
    MUSIC_DIRECTORY_PATH=/music
    # this is the path on the host
    MUSIC_DIRECTORY_SERVE_PATH=/srv/funkwhale/data/music


0.9.1 (2018-04-17)
------------------

Federation is here!
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is for real this time, and includes:

- Following other Funkwhale libraries
- Importing tracks from remote libraries (tracks are hotlinked, and only cached for a short amount of time)
- Searching accross federated catalogs

Note that by default, federation is opt-in, on a per-instance basis:
instances will request access to your catalog, and you can accept or refuse
those requests. You can also revoke the access at any time.

Documentation was updated with relevant instructions to use and benefit
from this new feature: https://docs.funkwhale.audio/federation.html

Preparing internationalization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Funkwhale's front-end as always been english-only, and this is a barrier
to new users. The work make Funkwhale's interface translatable was started
in this release by Baptiste. Although nothing is translated yet,
this release includes behind the stage changes that will make it possible in
the near future.

Many thank to Baptiste for the hard work and for figuring out a proper solution
to this difficult problem.

Upgrade path
^^^^^^^^^^^^

In addition to the usual instructions from
https://docs.funkwhale.audio/upgrading.html, non-docker users will have
to setup an additional systemd unit file for recurrent tasks.

This was forgotten in the deployment documentation, but recurrent tasks,
managed by the celery beat process, will be needed more and more in subsequent
releases. Right now, we'll be using to clear the cache for federated music files
and keep disk usage to a minimum.

In the future, they will also be needed to refetch music metadata or federated
information periodically.

Celery beat can be enabled easily::

    curl -L -o "/etc/systemd/system/funkwhale-beat.service" "https://dev.funkwhale.audio/funkwhale/funkwhale/raw/develop/deploy/funkwhale-beat.service"
    # Also edit /etc/systemd/system/funkwhale.target
    # and ensure the Wants= line contains the following:
    # Wants=funkwhale-server.service funkwhale-worker.service funkwhale-beat.service
    nano /etc/systemd/system/funkwhale.target
    # reload configuration
    systemctl daemon-reload

Docker users already have celerybeat enabled.

Preparing for federation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Federation of music libraries is one of the most asked feature.
While there is still a lot of work to do, this version includes
the foundation that will enable funkwhale servers to communicate
between each others, and with other federated software, such as
Mastodon.

Funkwhale will use ActivityPub as it's federation protocol.

In order to prepare for federation (see #136 and #137), new API endpoints
have been added under /federation and /.well-known/webfinger.

For these endpoints to work, you will need to update your nginx configuration,
and add the following snippets::

    location /federation/ {
        include /etc/nginx/funkwhale_proxy.conf;
        proxy_pass   http://funkwhale-api/federation/;
    }

    location /.well-known/webfinger {
        include /etc/nginx/funkwhale_proxy.conf;
        proxy_pass   http://funkwhale-api/.well-known/webfinger;
    }

This will ensure federation endpoints will be reachable in the future.
You can of course skip this part if you know you will not federate your instance.

A new ``FEDERATION_ENABLED`` env var have also been added to control whether
federation is enabled or not on the application side. This settings defaults
to True, which should have no consequences at the moment, since actual
federation is not implemented and the only available endpoints are for
testing purposes.

Add ``FEDERATION_ENABLED=false`` to your .env file to disable federation
on the application side.

To test and troubleshoot federation, we've added a bot account. This bot is available at @test@yourinstancedomain,
and sending it "/ping", for example, via Mastodon, should trigger
a response.

Upgrades notes
**************

This version contains breaking changes in the way funkwhale is deployed,
please read the notes carefully.

Instance timeline
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A new "Activity" page is now available from the sidebar, where you can
browse your instance activity. At the moment, this includes other users
favorites and listening, but more activity types will be implemented in the
future.

Internally, we implemented those events by following the Activity Stream
specification, which will help us to be compatible with other networks
in the long-term.

A new settings page has been added to control the visibility of your activity.
By default, your activity will be browsable by anyone on your instance,
but you can switch to a full private mode where nothing is shared.

The setting form is available in your profile.

Switch from gunicorn to daphne
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This release include an important change in the way we serve the HTTP API.
To prepare for new realtime features and enable websocket support in Funkwhale,
we are now using django-channels and daphne to serve HTTP and websocket traffic.

This replaces gunicorn and the switch should be easy assuming you
follow the upgrade process described bellow.

If you are using docker, please remove the command instruction inside the
api service, as the up-to-date command is now included directly in the image
as the default entry point:

.. code-block:: yaml

    api:
      restart: unless-stopped
      image: funkwhale/funkwhale:${FUNKWHALE_VERSION:-latest}
      command: ./compose/django/gunicorn.sh  # You can remove this line

On non docker setups, you'll have to update the [Service] block of your
funkwhale-server systemd unit file to launch the application server using daphne instead of gunicorn.

The new configuration should be similar to this:

.. code-block:: ini

    [Service]
    User=funkwhale
    # adapt this depending on the path of your funkwhale installation
    WorkingDirectory=/srv/funkwhale/api
    EnvironmentFile=/srv/funkwhale/config/.env
    ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/daphne -b ${FUNKWHALE_API_IP} -p ${FUNKWHALE_API_PORT} config.asgi:application

Ensure you update funkwhale's dependencies as usual to install the required
packages.

On both docker and non-docker setup, you'll also have to update your nginx
configuration for websocket support. Ensure you have the following blocks
included in your virtualhost file:

.. code-block:: text

    map $http_upgrade $connection_upgrade {
        default upgrade;
        ''      close;
    }

    server {
        ...
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection $connection_upgrade;
    }

Remember to reload your nginx server after the edit.

Transcoding:

Basic transcoding is now available to/from the following formats : ogg and mp3.

*This is still an alpha feature at the moment, please report any bug.*

This relies internally on FFMPEG and can put some load on your server.
It's definitely recommended you setup some caching for the transcoded files
at your webserver level. Check the the exemple nginx file at deploy/nginx.conf
for an implementation.

On the frontend, usage of transcoding should be transparent in the player.

Music Requests:

This release includes a new feature, music requests, which allows users
to request music they'd like to see imported.

an import is made.
